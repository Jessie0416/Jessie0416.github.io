                        <p><span style="color:#006666"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif">A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today that it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and consoling us in age.</span></span></span></p>

                        <p><span style="color:#006666"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif">Men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love they have for a book just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both entertain for a third. There is an old proverb, &lsquo;Love me, love my dog.&rdquo; But there is more wisdom in this:&rdquo; Love me, love my book.&rdquo; The book is a truer and higher bond of union. Men can think, feel, and sympathize with each other through their favorite author. They live in him together, and he in them.</span></span></span></p>

                        <p><span style="color:#006666"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif">Books possess an essence of immortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author&rsquo;s minds, ages ago. What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed page. The only effect of time have been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive e but what is really good.</span></span></span></p>
